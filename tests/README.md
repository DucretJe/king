# Tests

Those tests **must** succeed to merge a PR.

## Scenario

We mount an empty but functionnal Kong service using `docker-compose`.
It assumes that we provide a file named `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for its database to work.

We build King from `/docker/Dockerfile` and deploy it too.

## Test 1

We created a puppeteer script using Chrome.

</p>

The script has been modified to await `Kong node information` section to appear meaning it can connect to the Kong Admin API.

</p>




> ✅ The test is successful if puppeteer catch the string `Kong node information`

### Debug

Bumping from 3.0.9 to 3.0.11 the test was failing, and we figured out that due to a slight change in the UI of King, the automation was triggering a wrong button using the screenshot feature.

```js
await page.screenshot({ path: '/output/screenshot.png' });
```
